Make sure your project includes a README.TXT file
and that this file describes your refactoring 
implementations i.e. the class or classes used and who implemented them.

Refactoring Implementations:
1. No indication of login attempt if it fails - New Label in LoginView.java 
2. Reference to personal table in ticket - Removed in TicketController.java
3. Message chat display does not show 2 column view if only one person has sent a message - Reimplemented display logic in SupportTicketView.java 
4. DB errors just print to console and the app effectively crashes - Added message dialog system
5. There are no permission checks on the ticket messaging system yet - Added check in UI
6. Ticket list view does not filter by permissions - added check before 
7. Password is stored in plain text - Added bcrypt hashing in LoginController.java
8. No way to get back to list view from chat - Added Back button
9. Ticket view doesnâ€™t filter out archived conversations - Implemented archive list
10. All queries select all columns - Fixed queries in TicketController.java
11. No menu screen to chose app flow - Implemented app flow


Use Cases:
- Support Ticket
- Tracking Progress
- Sharing Progress
 
Login details:
login: admin
password: password

login: test_user
password: password

es the process of sharing progress by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps
