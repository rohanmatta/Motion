Use Cases Scoped for Design and Implementation (Track Progress System - Athlete)
1. The athlete logs into the system to access their workout history and to have progress tracking features.
2. Athlete Views Workout History
3. The athlete selects a past session to review details including sets, reps, duration, calories burned, and personal notes.
4. Athlete logs a New Workout Session
5. The athlete inputs workout details, including exercise type, sets, reps, duration, calories burned, and weight lifted.
6. Athlete views Progress Trends
7. The athlete views/analyzes overall performance trends, including average sets, reps, duration, and calories burned across workouts.
8. Athlete Updates Workout Notes
9. The athlete adds or modifies notes on past workout sessions to track progress and make edits.
